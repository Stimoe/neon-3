# neon-3

This was my final project for class.

After class I have been continueing to work on it when I have time. It is a card game where you build your deck as you move through the different levels. It was a lot of fun to make. It is built in React This application uses firebase, axios calls, bootstrap and many more

The deployed version of this game can be found at, https://neon-3-1.herokuapp.com/
